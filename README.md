# Advanced-Data-Structures
this repository was intended for a c++ library of advanced data structures and some algo's,
just like current STL has templates for structure like vector,stack etc, and algos like sort,next_perm etc..
here the templates for 
segment tree, fenwick tree, trie has been made ,and the user programmers can include the library,,and just 
initialize a segment tree like "segmenttree s",in its different uses they just need to provide a "combine function",just like 
they provided a comparator to the function "sort" or some others,also the defaults for all these functions are made inbuilt.
finally one algo is also added,
i look forward for others contribution to extend the list of included data structures and algos,,
and certainly their contribution will make ease for programmers and reduce effors in implementation of these structures and algos..
